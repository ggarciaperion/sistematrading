# Pull Request Creation - Final Status

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

All required changes have been successfully implemented, tested, and pushed to the branch:
**`copilot/fix-operation-id-sequence-one-more-time`**

## üìã Summary

This branch implements atomic EXP-ID generation to prevent race conditions when creating operations concurrently in the SQLite database.

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Added `import time`** at the top of `app.py` for retry/backoff logic

2. **Modified `init_db()` function** (lines 342-354):
   - Creates `operation_seq` table with constraint `CHECK (id = 1)` to ensure single row
   - Seeds table with initial value `(1, 1000)`
   - First generated ID will be `EXP-1001`

3. **Rewrote `generar_idop()` function** (lines 713-772):
   - Uses `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` for exclusive write lock
   - Atomically reads, increments, and updates `operation_seq.last_num`
   - Includes retry logic with exponential backoff (5 attempts)
   - Falls back to legacy method if `operation_seq` unavailable

4. **Updated `create_operation()` route** (line 2599):
   - Replaced inline ID generation with call to `generar_idop(conn)`
   - Ensures atomic ID generation for all new operations

5. **Added `.gitignore`** to exclude Python cache files and build artifacts

## ‚úÖ Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ‚úÖ Sequential ID generation works (EXP-1001, EXP-1002, etc.)
- ‚úÖ operation_seq counter increments correctly
- ‚úÖ Fallback mode works when operation_seq is unavailable
- ‚úÖ Python syntax validation passed
- ‚úÖ init_db() creates and seeds table correctly
